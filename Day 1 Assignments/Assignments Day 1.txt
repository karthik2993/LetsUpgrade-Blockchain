1) what is your understanding about blockchain?
--> Blockchain technology enables distributed public ledgers that hold immutable data in a secure and encrypted way and ensure that transactions can never be altered.
--> we can also called blockchain as same set of data which are stored in different computers in different places
--> It is also used to prevent from data getting hacked , to boost high security transparency, and decentralization. 

2) what is core Problem blockchain trying to solve?
-->Currency and Transaction Support
-->Supply Chains and Item Histories
-->Voting
-->Government Operations
-->Intellectual Property
-->Real Estate
-->charity


3)what are the few features blockchain will give u ?
-->Cannot be Corrupted
-->Decentralized Technology
-->Enhanced Security
-->Distributed Ledgers
-->Faster Settlement

4)what all things blockchain contain?
-->The Blockchain is a database, which is distributed among all nodes.
-->No one or several nodes control the Blockchain.
-->All nodes are able to validate a transaction.
-->All communication on the Blockchain is p2p.
-->All transactions occurring on a Blockchain are recorded there, so the transactions of any person using the network are public and completely transparent, even though they may be anonymous.
-->Once a transaction is recorded on the Blockchain and the Blockchain has updated, then that transaction cannot be altered.
-->No one person or organization can turn off a Blockchain.

5) How is verifiability of blockchain is attained ?
-->In Blockchain Verifiability can be achived by following points :
   Data
   Previous fingerprints
   Current fingerprints
   consider an example of Banking Transaction,when Transaction is done by specific customer Transaction history get stotred in specfic block and generate Current finger prints,
   after certain period of again he does a Transaction this time transaction history is stored in another block with previous finger prints as well as current finger prints in 
   this way we can achieve a Verifiability.
